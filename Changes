Revision history for Perl extension Acme::DonMartin.

0.08 2006-11-02 16:08:27 UTC
    - Clarified the licensing of the module
    - Moved the module into subversion.

0.07 2006-07-10 08:38:39 UTC
    - Added license information.
    - Rewrite the source file on the first pass, instead of
      printing it to STDOUT (to be more conformant with
      Acme Best Practices).
    - Fixed cross-platform line-endings bug (a program with
      Unix line-endings wouldn't work on Windows -- and no
      doubt vice versa). Credit goes to Georg Moritz for
      spotting this bug.
    - The test suite now uses Test::Cmd and Test::File::Contents
      which should improve portability.
    - Minor improvements to code readability, deployed a
      superiour variable naming convention.

0.06 Mon Sep 26 14:48:27 2005 UTC
    - Use Config.pm to figure out which perl executable to
      employ for certain tests.

0.05 Sun Sep 25 16:27:53 2005 UTC
    - Kwalitee whoring release. Changed qq{ ... } to "..."
      to use Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage. No change
      in functionality.

0.04 Tue Sep 13 14:46:31 2005 UTC
    - Eval'ed the use of Test::Pod incorrectly. Bug spotted
      by Adriano Ferreira.

0.03 Sun Sep 11 10:02:48 2005 UTC
    - Added POD coverage tests

0.02 Sat Apr 9 10:49:04 2005 UTC
    - Now runs under 'use strict' (hey, one more Kwalitee
      point is better than nothing).
    - Made the source code more readable.

0.01 Fri Apr 8 18:04:47 2005 UTC
    - First release
