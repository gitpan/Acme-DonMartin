BUGS

I have made a simple attempt to create a test suite for this
module. It works for me, but it will break if the test suite
can't find the perl executable somewhere on the PATH. If this
is too error prone, I'll do something about it. In the mean-
time, in spite of the failure, you will probably find that
the module works as advertised.
